# Minimal Resume Template for Quarto üíº

Minimal Resume is a Quarto template that uses a YAML header (YAML Ain‚Äôt Markup Language) to define the contents for a minimal resume. The template uses a minimal file structure, consisting of only two files:

- `resume.qmd`: the Quarto Markdown file configuring the contents of the resume. It uses YAML metadata to define variables such as first and last names, contact information, as well as populate resume sections such as education, skills, projects, and experience.

- `template.tex`: the LaTeX file used to structure the YAML content into the final PDF output. It defines custom LaTeX commands for structuring the resume layout, styling headers, defining resume items, etc.

## How to Use

1. **Edit Resume Information**: open the `resume.qmd` file in a text editor and edit the YAML metadata to include your personal information, education, skills, projects, and job experience.

2. **Define the Output File Options**: modify the last section of the YAML header to define options such as paper size, margins, line spacing, font size, etc.

3. **Generate PDF Output**: use Quarto Markdown to render the `resume.qmd` file into a PDF. You can use the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   quarto render resume.qmd
   ```

    This command will generate a PDF file named `resume.pdf` based on the content and formatting defined in the `resume.qmd` file.

## YAML Header
The YAML header in the `resume.qmd` file is used to define the contents and formatting of the resume. Each parameter in the YAML header specifies different elements of the resume, such as personal information, education, skills, projects, experience, formatting options, and output format. 

Below is a list of all parameters used in this template and how to use them. A few notes on usage:
- Make sure you format the YAML elements as described below.
- Use dashes as specified below, only to define resume items within YAML arrays (eductional degrees, job experiences, skills), not each element in the YAML.
### Resume Header
